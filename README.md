## üß† Machine Learning (Random Forest)

We use a **Random Forest Classifier** to help users understand whether their chosen subscription plan is good or bad, based on:

- Cost per member
- Total duration
- Platform reputation
- Usage frequency
- User rating
- Historical data of similar plans

The ML model is trained and tested using `scikit-learn` and integrated into the backend using Python APIs or precomputed predictions.
